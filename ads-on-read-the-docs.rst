Advertising on Read the Docs Community Sites
============================================

On Monday we started adding a small ad on readthedocs.org pages.
This ad is totally unintrusive to the browsing and usage of documentation pages,
and doesn't enable third-party tracking of users in any way.
This is an effort to help fundraise to support continuned support and maintanance on the project.

We want to share a little bit of our thinking behind this,
and hope that you understand why we've made this decision.

Sustainability
--------------

Read the Docs is a :doc:`massive project <read-the-docs-2015-stats>`,
and requires a large amount of work to keep running.
I've personally been wearing a pager in support of the project for over 4 years,
all of this work being unpaid.
We also recieve multiple GitHub issues every day,
many of which aren't answered in a timely fashion because noone is paid to answer them.

Read the Docs is heavily used by open source,
but there is no money behind this.
We have done multiple types of donation drives and other ways of asking users for money,
however our users are the last one we want to charge.
Our primary users are other open source projects who aren't paid themselves!
This puts us in a hard situation,
and where selling a small amount of documentation reader attention is the best way forward to support the project.


No Tracking
-----------

We firmly believe that the major issue with the advertising industry isn't advertising,
but tracking of users and third party scripts.
To address this view,
we don't allow any tracking of our users by third-party scripts.

We do record the number of impressions each image gets from our server logs,
and we track clicks with Google Analytics,
which only we have access to.

The Future
----------

In a perfect world we wouldn't include advertising on our pages.
If you are at a company or some other instuation that would like to fund operations, 
support,
and development of the project,
please contact us!

We are looking at ways of allowing people to opt out of advertising on their documentation pages.
One of the simplest ways we are considering adding an exception is for people who contribute to the project.
Whether you write code, docs, or help with issues,
getting more support for the project is the main goal of this endevour.
We ask that companies using our software consider switching to the paid verison over at http://readthedocs.com/.

For the forseeable future we don't have a viable model to support the Read the Docs community site without advertising.
We hope that you understand our thoughts here,
and we're always happy to field new ideas that might allow us to not requier this in the future!
