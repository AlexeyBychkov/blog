Advertising on Read the Docs Community Sites
============================================

On Monday, we enabled an ad space on documentation pages hosted on readthedocs.org.
We have tested the ad space in the past,
and had followed up with a :doc:`discussion of the implications <state-of-the-docs-2015>` of advertising.
The space was meant to be totally unobtrusive to the browsing and usage of documentation pages,
and doesn't enable third-party tracking of users in any way.
This is all in an effort to help raise funds to support continued support and maintenance on the project,
and ensure free and open documentation stays available.

Sustainability
--------------

Read the Docs is a :doc:`massive project <read-the-docs-2015-stats>`,
and requires a large amount of work to keep running and support.
We receive support requests and must tend to the operations of the servers on a daily basis.
Neither of these tasks lend to volunteer contributions,
they both require dedicated support roles for such a large site.
**I've personally been wearing a pager in support of the project for over 4 years,
all on a volunteer basis.**

Though we have done multiple donation drives,
and have enabled other ways for users to support us,
these only supply a limited amount of funding.
Our users are the last ones we want to charge,
they are other open source projects who aren't paid themselves!
This puts us in a hard situation.
Selling a small amount of documentation reader attention allows us to sustainably support Read the Docs without affecting authors.

No Tracking
-----------

We firmly believe that the major issue with the advertising industry isn't advertising,
but tracking of users and third-party scripts.
**To address this,
we don't allow any tracking of our users by third-party scripts.**

We do record the number of impressions each image gets from our server logs,
and we track clicks with Google Analytics,
which only we have access to.

The Future
----------

In a perfect world we wouldn't include advertising on our pages.
If you are at a company or another institution that would like to fund operations,
support,
and development of the project,
please `contact us`_!

We are looking at additional ways of allowing people to opt-out of advertising on their documentation pages.
If you haven't donated in the past, or don't have a gold subscription,
we are considering adding an exception for people who contribute their time to the project.
Whether you write code, docs, or help with support,
we'd wholly appreciate your contributions.
If you can't offer support, either a donation or with your time,
but are conflicted by sponsor advertising on your open source project's documentation,
we can consider an opt-out if you open an issue on our issue tracker.
Commercial projects can consider supported plans on our paid version, available at http://readthedocs.com.

For the foreseeable future, supporting the Read the Docs community site with advertising is our most viable model.
We hope that you understand our thoughts here,
and we're always happy to have feedback or to field new ideas that might allow us to not require this in the future!
